# HappinessPredictor
Used the World Happiness Index dataset to find the best country happiness score prediction outcome possible using just a single feature, GDP.

Used the best Cross validation score for paramter tuning on various models.

This project was intended to explore various models to use single feature prediction, constraining the relationship between the feature and predictor to be non-linear so as to not make it trivial.

The predicted values of each tuned model were plotted against the actual values for comparison
